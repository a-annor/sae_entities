Explain your answer.\\n\\nAnswer:\\n\\nStep 1/2\\nFirst, we need to consider the skills and abilities of each person. The grandson is likely to have a better understanding of the Uber app and how to use it effectively. He may also have a better grasp of the local area and be able to navigate the city more efficiently. On the other hand, the grandfather may have more experience with traditional taxi services and may be more familiar with the local drivers and routes.\\n\\nStep 2/2\\nAdditionally, the grandfather may have a better understanding of the local language and customs, which could be beneficial in communicating with the driver. Based on these factors, it is likely that the grandson would be more likely to succeed in booking a cab on Uber. However, it is important to note that both the grandson and the grandfather have the potential to succeed in this task, and it ultimately depends on their individual skills and abilities.'"
