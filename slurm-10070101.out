It was my first exposure to the idea of a liberal arts college. It was like I had come into contact with another country, another world. And it was the first time I knew of this thing called “selective college”.

I have always been good at writing, so in my last year I began writing for a newspaper, a school paper. The name was called the “Yale Times”. And I was one of the reporters.
